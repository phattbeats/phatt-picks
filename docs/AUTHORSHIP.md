# Authorship policy

Every phatt-picks commit must have the author identity `phattbeats <obiwouldjablowme@protonmail.com>` and must contain no `Co-authored-by` trailer, regardless of its name or email. Configure a clone with `git config user.name phattbeats` and `git config user.email obiwouldjablowme@protonmail.com`, then run `npm run hooks:install` (or `npm install`, which runs it automatically). In Claude Code, set `includeCoAuthoredBy` to `false` in user or project `settings.json`; OpenClaw/Paperclip commit paths follow the same rule.

The `core.hooksPath` is wired through `package.json` so `npm install` installs the gate automatically. The CI workflow in `.github/workflows/authorship-check.yml` re-validates the full commit range on every PR and push to `main`, so a bad author or a stray `Co-authored-by` trailer cannot land even if a developer skips the hook.
